What is this?
==

Do you record your sleep phases with [zeo mobile](http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/shop/featured-products/zeo-sleep-manager-mobile-pro.html)?
If you're having naps or doing [polyphasic sleep](http://six40winks.com/about/) 
then you probably only get to see the core-sleep on the website. 
The code in this repository can help you rescue all the sleep data from your android phone.
This has the code necessary to build an android app (at least under Ubuntu 12.04 where it was tested, 
but it should be quite universal)

Disclaimers!!
==

This app has been developed independently of zeo-eng or the ZEO Inc. company.	
**Zeo is in no way related to this code** or responsible for any error, omission or problem with it.
This code however was built based on [zeo-android-api](https://github.com/zeoeng/zeo-android-api).
But be warned: This code may eat your phone and spit a pile of rubble.  You've been warned.
